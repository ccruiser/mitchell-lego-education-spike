# Mitchell Robotics - Team Robo-Mustangs : Week One

This was a great week for the students. After snacks the group met upstairs in one of the computer lab classrooms facing the commons area. We then set team expecatations, agreed on a team name (Robo-Mustangs), introduced the season's theme, and breifly touched on seasonal theme of Archology. At the end our time we divided the challenge field bags into builder sets so that the students could begin to build the robot challenge stations at home. 

## Takeaways

Each student is being asked to complete a challlenge station prior to returning to our meeting on Sept. 24th. It is very important that the students keep track of all the lego materials and that we do not loose any peices. We cannot order individual sets and trust that each student is responsible and accountable with their assigned set. See Challenge Set Build instructions below for more details.

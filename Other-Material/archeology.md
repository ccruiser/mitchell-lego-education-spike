# Archeology

##### (And Other Useful Information)

## Project Question

What is a real-world problem faced archeologiest and what is your innovative or improvement solution?

### Requirements

- Research existing solutions and problems

- Develop an innovative of improved solution

- Teams must also create an innovative prototype 

- Teams must share their findings

- Teams must use feedback from the real-world to refine the solution (e.g. industry experts

### Thought Exercises

1. Preservation of artifacts - ancient artifacts and objects can decay due to exposure of sunlight, air and moisture

2. Looting and Illegal excavation of artifacts - treasure hunters sometimes steal objects and destroy the important historical context 

3. Funding and res ource constraints - excavation and research are expensive and archeologist often struggle to receive enough support for various projects

4. Harsh and extreme geographical and weather conditions - sites and locations can be difficult to explore due to heat, rain or flooding

5. Limited Technology - even with modern tools, it can be difficult to fully anaylize some artifacts or buried sites and structures

6. Cultural Sensitivity - archeologiest must respect the traditions and the beliefs of people connected to a site (this one might be a challenge to consider)

7. Time Constraints - construction projects or erosion can destroy sites before they can be properly studied
